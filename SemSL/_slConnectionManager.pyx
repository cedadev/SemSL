Connection management for Sem-SL.  Operation:
o. Connections are made via the backends and kept in a "Connection Pool".
o. When connections are made they are locked and then can be released so that
   they can be reused without having to re-establish the connection.
o. When a connection is closed it is removed from the pool.
